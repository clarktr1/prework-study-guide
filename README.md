## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

This Prework Study Guide is the result of my self-guided practice through SMU's Software Development Bootcamp Prework Course. This project was done because of my motivation and willingness to branch out and change careers from Music Education to Software Development. This guide can be used to review brief bullet topics that related to some of the larger topics that will be discussed in the program. I learned how to utilize some of the basic coding language: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as effective interact with GitHub and its features.
